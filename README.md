# User Information Viewer

This Java application, **User Information Viewer**, provides a simple graphical interface to input and display user information, including name, marital status, and major.

## Authors

- Dominic Rucker

## Overview

The application consists of two classes:

- **InfoViewer**: The main class that initializes the Swing GUI for user interaction.
- **InfoFrame**: A JFrame class that represents the user interface for entering and displaying user information.

## How to Use

1. Run the application by executing the `InfoViewer` class. The GUI will appear.

2. You can input your name, select your marital status (Single, Married, Separated), and choose your major from the available options (e.g., Computer Science, Biology, Nursing).

3. The application dynamically updates labels to display the entered information. Your name is displayed in the "Name" panel, and your selected marital status and major are shown in the respective panels.

4. You can explore the code for further understanding. The application uses Swing components for GUI development, including labels, text fields, radio buttons, and combo boxes.

Feel free to customize and extend this simple Java Swing application to suit your specific needs.
